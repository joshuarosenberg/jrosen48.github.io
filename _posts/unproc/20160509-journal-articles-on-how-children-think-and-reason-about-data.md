# Journal articles about how children think and reason about data

As the list of articles got longer, I became reticent to post it, but decided to just as a helpful exercise. I wrote posts previously about [books on how children reason about data](/books-on-how-children-think-and-reason-about-data/) and [open datasets for educational use](http://jmichaelrosenberg.com/open-datasets-for-educational-use/). I also wanted to post a few (okay, a little more than a few) of the relevant journal articles (and a few book chapters) I've tried to track down. I focused mostly on science settings.
