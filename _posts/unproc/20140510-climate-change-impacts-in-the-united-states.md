# Climate change impacts in the United States

Without having thought deeply about this or looked into it in a lot, I think we aren't very prone to do something about climate change because its effects seem both far in the future, and in a lot of cases, far away from where we live. I read the report titled "[National Climate Assessment,](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/)" which caught my attention perhaps because it discussed effects at this point in time, and in the place where I live.
