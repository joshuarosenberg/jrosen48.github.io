# What is contextual teaching and learning?

Ralph Putnam and Hilda Borko published a chapter - "The Role of Context in Teacher Learning and Teacher Education" - in the book _[Contextual Teaching and Learning: Preparing Teachers to Enhance Student Success in the Workplace and Beyond](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED427263). _ I have wrote about my interest in [studying "context" before](http://joshuamrosenberg.com/what-i-learned-this-school-year/) and am currently working with my advisor on a book chapter on the importance of context to understanding teaching with technology for the _[Handbook of Research on Teacher Education in the Digital Age](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CEAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.igi-global.com%2Fpublish%2Fcall-for-papers%2Fcall-details%2F1239&ei=_jCDU8KkHoWuyASHy4D4Bg&usg=AFQjCNGSDcvf3gOQHD-kikS8h75PT0gnZQ&sig2=-JNm9t2vVKLY3PJ4vNkoNQ&bvm=bv.67720277,d.aWw). _
