# What do people tweet at #aect15 ? (Day 1)

This week, [Spencer Greenhalgh](http://www.spencergreenhalgh.com/2015/11/03/what-do-people-tweet-at-aect15-day-1/) and I are attending the AECT conference for the first time. We’re here to present on some Twitter research we’re doing (among other things), so we thought it would be fun to take a quasi-real time look at what people are tweeting. We’re collecting tweets from the hashtags #aect, #aect15 (the official hashtag), and #aect2015 using [TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info/)—the Twitter-Archiving Google Sheet&mdash. It’s a pretty handy tool that lets you collect Twitter data without too much hassle. You can see the collection of tweets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qzoOu_UY63ZWnXPIrzigDdnI4mddk-gFupvudO3JGQM/edit#gid=8743918).
