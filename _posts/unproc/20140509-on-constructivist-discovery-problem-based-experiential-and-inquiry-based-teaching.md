# On constructivist, discovery, problem-based, experiential, and inquiry-based  teaching

Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) published an [article](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1#.U2zima1dXIA) on why "constructivist, discovery, problem-based, experiential, and inquiry-based teaching" don't work.In short, these pedagogies ignore principles from cognitive science - by overloading learners' working memory, so learners cannot form long-term memories - and are not supported by research. This article built [an earlier article](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/59/1/14/) by Mayer (2004) arguing that discovery learning is not as effective as guided discovery.
