# Notes from two TPACK literature reviews

Two literature reviews about TPACK have recently been published - in [Educational Technology and Society](http://www.ifets.info/abstract.php?art_id=1349) (Chai, Koh, & Tsai, 2013) and the [Journal of Computer Assisted Learning](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2729.2012.00487.x) (Voogt, Fisser, Roblin, Tondeur, & van Braak, 2012).
