# Lave

I am familiar with Jean Lave's articulation that thinking and behaving is [connected to individual's day-t0-day activities in real-world settings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition). I also knew about Lave and Wenger's articulation of [legitimate peripheral participation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation) in a [community of practice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) as a process of learning.
