# New article in Tech Trends: Design guidelines for graduate program social media use

In 2014, Colin Terry, John Bell, Virginia Hiltz, Tracy Russo, and other members of a group interested in social media within our Educational Psychology and Educational Technology program presented a paper on best practices for graduate program social media use at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education conference. We're excited the article is now published in TechTrends. You can check it out (there's no paywall - at least now) [here](http://link.springer.com/journal/11528/onlineFirst/page/1) along with other forthcoming papers including one by [my colleague Mete Akcaoglu on game design and learning](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-016-0022-y).
