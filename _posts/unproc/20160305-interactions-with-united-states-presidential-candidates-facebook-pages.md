# Interactions with the 2016 United States Presidential Candidates

I came across [this post on how to scrape data from Facebook pages](http://minimaxir.com/2015/07/facebook-scraper/) for statistical analysis, and was motivated to give it a try. After thinking about which pages (including pages for educational organizations and communities) would be interesting to analyze, I looked at interactions with 2016 United States Presidential candidate's Facebook pages. While the files referenced in the post used Python, you could certainly do the same in R, but I had been looking for a chance to try out Python.
