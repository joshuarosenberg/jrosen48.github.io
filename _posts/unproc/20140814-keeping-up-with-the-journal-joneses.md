# Keeping up with the journal Joneses

Early in graduate school journals were very inaccessible to me. I did not know where to start, or what to read once I found one. Over time I started to develop my understanding of where to start and what and how to read, but did not have a way of staying on top of them with some type of regularity. I tried to subscribe to RSS feeds through the journals' websites, or to follow the journals through social media or e-mail updates. None of these worked particularly well, despite receiving updates, with one reason being that you still have to search for the journal through the library in order to access its contents.
