# Similarities between early machine learning programs and massive open online courses (MOOCS)

I borrowed _[Automatic Teaching](http://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Teaching-The-State-Art/dp/B0000CKG3A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1383179316&sr=8-1&keywords=automatic+teaching%2C+galanter) _(1959) to learn about the history of educational technology. I was surprised by similarities between early [machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) programs and today's [massive open online courses (MOOCs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course).
