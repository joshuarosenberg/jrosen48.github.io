# Research Methods in Educational Technology

Educational technology is a diverse field - check out the recent publication _[Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology_](http://aect.site-ym.com/?page=handbook_of_research) for a survey of the diversity of educational technology. Psychology is also diverse - see the [APA Handbook of Educational Psychology](http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4311503.aspx), which comprises three volumes and is 1843 pages.
