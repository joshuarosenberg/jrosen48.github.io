# Five lessons learned about interviewing

I first thought interviewing would be easy, but have learned the hard way it is not. This post is a reflection rather than advice (here's a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Interviewing-Qualitative-Research-Researchers-Education/dp/0807754048/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400682295&sr=8-1&keywords=interviewing+seidman) for advice), about interviewing, from interviewing as part of a research project focused on how middle school students participate in scientific practices.
