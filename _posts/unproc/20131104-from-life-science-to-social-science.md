# From life science to social science

Until recently, I have not thought about what it means to be a [social scientist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science). My undergraduate degree was in biology, with coursework in other [natural sciences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science); despite attending a liberal arts university ([UNC Asheville](http://unca.edu)), social science classes I took in introductory and educational psychology were interesting but did not affect my core. Consequently, I graduated knowing about social science without having tried what it is to think like a social scientist.
