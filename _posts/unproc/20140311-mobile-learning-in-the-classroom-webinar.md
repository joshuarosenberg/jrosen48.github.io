# Mobile learning in the classroom webinar

The MAET program has a webinar series called MAET Bridge (more [here](http://edutech.msu.edu/2014/02/05/the-bridge-webinar-series-digital-games-and-learning/) and [here](http://edutech.msu.edu/2014/03/10/the-bridge-webinar-series-mobile-learning-in-the-classroom/)). and I was part of a webinar today on mobile learning in the classroom with Candace Marcotte ([@canmarcotte](http://twitter.com/canmarcotte)), Brett Koph ([@brettkopf](http://twitter.com/brettkopf)), and Sandra Sawaya ([@sandrasawaya](http://twitter.com/sandrasawaya)). I think it was an interesting talk of which I appreciated being part.
