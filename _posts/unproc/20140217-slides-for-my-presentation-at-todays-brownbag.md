# Slides for my presentation at today

In my research, I focus on how social and cultural factors affect how individuals teach and learn, so that I can understand and design learning environments that support learning with technology for all students, and in particular disadvantaged students. This is important because how youth access and use technology leads to different educational outcomes, which are important with respect to how youth develop personal and occupational interests that are individually and socially valuable.
