My research focuses on a) data-intensive approaches to understanding students' motivation and engagement in science, b) students' work with data, and c) teachers' use of innovative practices.

### Data-intensive approaches to understanding students' motivation and engagement in science

* A Psychological Approach to Understanding Student Engagement Through Trace Data

* Exploring Student Engagement in Science with a Person-in-Context Approach

### Students' Work with Data

* Creating and Analyzing Data from Simulations: High School Physics Studentsâ€™ Modeling Simulated Data to Make Sense of Scientific Phenomena

### Teachers' Use of Innovative Practices

* Teachers' Synchronous and Asynchronous Uses of the Same Twitter Hashtag

* An Influence Model of Teachers' Interactions on Twitter

* Automated Approaches to Understanding Students' Epistemic Considerations

* Teachers' Use of Scientific Modeling Over a Long Period of Time

### Completed Research Projects

* Context and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK)

* Understanding the Purposes of Twitter Across a Graduate Educational Technology Program

* Assessing Technological Knowledge Through Teachers' Digital Teaching Portfolios
